<p>Once the order has been placed, we will send the details of the order made together with the confirmation email for the customer to confirm the order.</p> 

<p>If the customer wants to cancel the order, the customer is advised to immediately call our service line at 03-54822244 within 24 hours after the order has been placed.

<p>If payment has been made, we will ask you to refill the details and account number to make it easier for us to make a refund to the customer.</p>
